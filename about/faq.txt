[h1]Frequently Asked Questions[/h1]

This page contains a number of questions that I get asked on a regular basis.
Given that I'm not always the fastest to respond to email, you should probably
read these first!

[h2]How do I submit photos?[/h2]
In the near future I hope to deploy a method for people to upload photographs
directly, but in the meantime, see [url=/photos/submissions.txt]here[/url].

[h2]Can you provide information about rail travel in NSW?[/h2]
Unfortunately not.  For rail travel within NSW, probably the best place to
look is the following:

[ulist]
[*] [url=www.131500.info]Trip Planner[/url] (within Sydney)
[*] [url=www.countrylink.info]CountryLink[/url] (outside of Sydney)
[/ulist]

[h2]I'm looking for some information about NSW Railway history. Can you
help?[/h2]
Maybe...  I do have a fair amount of historic resources about the NSW
railways, but there are some other places you could look:

[ulist]
[*] [url=www.railpage.com.au]RailPage[/url] is a web site devoted
to Australia railways. There are forums that cover current and historic
railway topics.
[*] [url=www.arhsnsw.com.au]Australian Railway Historic Society (NSW)[/url]
is the [i]major[/i] organisation covering the history of NSW railways.
They have a large number of books for sale, as well as a significant archive
of railway-related information.
[*] [url=www.records.nsw.gov.au]State Records[/url] is the place to go if you
need even more information about NSW Government Railways.  This is the
archives of various NSW governments over the years.
[/ulist]

[h2]I'm looking for information about a relative who work in the railways. Can
you help?[/h2]
I really can't help. See the previous question for some places to look.

[h2]Can I use some of the photos on your website?[/h2]
Yes, but... they are copyright to their respective owners. For photos that I
own, just drop me an email and ask. For photos owned by other people, I can
put you in contact with the copyright owner.

[h2]... but it's only for private purposes[/h2]
Of course I can't stop you from saving the photos on your computer. But if you
are going to publish them in some form (even if if it just within a closed
circle of people), you need to clear it with the copyright owner. It's only
fair on the people who own the photos, right?

[h2]Can I have access to your data?[/h2]
Sure! Drop me an email and we can work out the best way to get the data to you
in a form that you can use.
