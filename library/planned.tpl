There were a large number of lines which were planned for NSW, but never
built.  Some never made it past the survey stage, some were authorised
for construction but never built, and some were abandoned during
construction.
</p>
<p>
The following lines were authorised by an Act of legislation, but never
completed:
</p>

<!-- BEGIN LINE -->
<h2>{NAME}</h2>

<blockquote>
<h3>{ACT}:</h3>
<p>

<!-- BEGIN COST-SECTION -->
<p>

</p>
<!-- END COST-SECTION -->
</blockquote>

<!-- BEGIN NOTE-SECTION -->
<p>
<b>Note:</b> {NOTE}
</p>
<!-- END NOTE-SECTION -->
<!-- END LINE -->
