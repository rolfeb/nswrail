<h1>{TITLE}</h1>

<p>This is a brief (but hopefully still accurate!) overview of signalling
as used in NSW.  I am not safeworking expert, so if there are errors
please <a href="mailto:nswrail@pobox.com">let me know</a>.</p>

<div class="boxed">
For an authoritative description of signalling in NSW see the
<a href="http://www.railsafe.org.au/">RailCorp RailSafe website</a>,
and in particular refer to

<h2>Double Colour Lights</h2>

<p>Double light signals are used mainly in the area where suburban and
inter-urban passenger trains are used.  The top light indicates
whether a train can proceed or not, whereas the second light indicates
the state of the next signal down the line.  Giving the driver an
indication of the following signal allows closer and more efficient
running of trains in the busy CityRail network.</p>

<p>Often only a subset of these signals are used.  In much of Sydney
you will only see STOP, CAUTION and CLEAR aspects.</p>

<p>These signals are divided into two types: <i>controlled</i> (also known
as <i>absolute</i>) and
<i>automatic</i> (a.k.a. <i>permissive</i>).
Controlled signals are operated by signal boxes and allow for protection of
junctions and such.  Automatic signals are not directly controlled;
their purpose is to maintain the separation of trains.</p>

<h3>Automatic Signals</h3>

<p>Automatic signals can be distinguished from controlled signals in that the
lights are vertically offset from each other.</p>

<h3>Controlled Signals</h3>

<p>Controlled signals are controlled from a signal box.  They are typically used
before facing junctions and other areas which need protection.</p>

<h2>Signalling Terminology</h2>

<dl>
<dt><i>Home Signal</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A signal which protects an interlocking area, for example a junction,
crossing or yard.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>Outer Home Signal</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A signal which protect the region outside a home signal.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>Distant Signal</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>A caution signal which warns of a following home signal.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>Landmark Signal</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Effectively a distant signal fixed at caution.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>Starting Signal</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The signal which controls the entry of a train into the next section.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Other Signals and Related Equipment</h2>

<dl>
<dt><i>Guard's Indicator</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a small black box usually mounted under the awning at a station,
with the words "GUARDS INDICATOR" written above a white light.  This 
light is illuminated when it is safe for the train to leave the station.
It is provided for the train guard, so that he/she does not blow the
whistle for the train to leave when it is not safe to do so.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>Train Stop</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Throughout the Sydney metropolitan network, you will notice a silver
box with an arm attached to the side which can be raised or lowered.
These are situated on the left hand side of the track, usually next
to a signal.  These are known as train stops.  When a signal prevents a
train from proceeding, the arm is raised.  If a passenger train attempts
to pass the location, the arm hits the trip valve on the front, which forces
the brakes to come one.</p>

<p>You might also notice these spread out along the platform at City Circle
stations.  These are used in conjunction with low-speed signalling to allow
trains to run closer than normal, while still preventing a collision.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>Landmark Signal</i></dt>
<dd>
<img src="images/landmark.gif" style="float: left;" alt="landmark" />
<p>A yellow triangular which serves as a fixed distant signal.  It is used
to indicate that a train should approach with caution.  These are often
seen on country branch lines at the approaches to significant locations.</p>
