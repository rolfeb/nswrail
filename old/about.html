<h1>About... these pages</h1>

<h2>Viewing</h2>

<p>These pages are designed to be as useable under as many browsers as
reasonably possible.  I use Netscape to view them but there is no reason
why you should have to!  For optimum viewing I suggest that your browser
window is at least 640 pixels wide, that you have Style Sheets and
JavaScript enabled (don't worry about the latter - it is just used 
to update the status line when you move the cursor over a line in the
search maps).</p>

<p> If you come across pages with broken or poor formatting, please let me
know.</p>

<h2>Page Construction</h2>

<p>All these pages are developed on my Linux machine at home.  The contents
are generated from a variety of source files.
The whole process is controlled by a set of makefiles; a total rebuild
takes around 2 hours.</p>

<p>The base rail data is stored in a MySQL database.  Location descriptions
are stored in XML files.  Photographs are scanned in with a Umax 610S
scanner and cleaned up with Gimp.  The thumbnails are built automatically
using the pbmplus tools.  The location diagrams are created using tgif.
The rail line description pages are then built by a series of perl
scripts.</p>

<p>The line maps were digitised from AUSLIG 1:250k scanned topo maps using
the Genasys GIS.  The topographic map data is AUSLIG's 1:2.5 million
dataset.  The maps are constructed in PostScript and then automatically
rendered using Xvfb.  The imagemap data for the search maps is build
using some cunning post-processing of the GIS line buffer command.</p>

<p>Many of the other pages are either generated from existing data, or
written by hand.
All pages have their final formatting done using Cascading Style Sheets.
This ensures they have a consistent look.</p>

<p>The search engine is a simple file based 2-level file scan to get
the right data.  It is a fairly simple PHP function.</p>

<h2>About... me</h2>

<img src="images/colorado.jpg" align="right" alt="photo of me">
<p>
I have worked in software development since 1987, mainly in the C/UNIX
arena.  These pages allow me to combine my interests in programming,
Internet publishing, digital mapping and railways, at the expense of having
no life!</p>

<p>I have always been interested in trains (I used to catch the old red
rattlers to school from the age of 7), but only took up photography
about 5 years ago.  Hence my interest in the old branch lines of NSW
came at a time when their heyday had passed.  Nevertheless, I am
very much interested in preserving as much information about what 
they were like before the whole lot rots away.</p>

<p>I have never had the motivation to get seriously into the mechanics
of photography.  I stick with my trusty Canon EOS 500, with 28-80
zoom lens.  I have not got around to playing about with slide film,
relying on Kodak Gold 100 film for all my photos.</p>

<p>Having said that, I have recently started using a Nikon Coolpix 5700
digital camera.  This is a rather impressive beast!</p>
