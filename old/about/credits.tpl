<h1>{TITLE}</h1>

I started these pages several years ago out of a desire to explore my
personal interests in Internet publishing, railways and digital mapping.
Although the work was purely self-motivated, I regularly receive the kind of
feedback which reminds me that there are other people with the same
interests out there. I am constantly reminded that the Internet is a huge
agent for the fostering of communities.
<p/>

Thanks to everyone who has dropped me a line!

The content of these pages would be a lot poorer without the contributions
I have received from many people, ranging from simple corrections to
extremely generous photographic contributions. I would like to express my
gratitude to:
