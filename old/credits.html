<h1>Credits and Thanks</h1>

<p>I started these pages several years ago out of a desire to explore my
personal interests in Internet publishing, railways and digital mapping.
Although the work was purely self-motivated, I regularly receive the
kind of feedback which reminds me that there are other people with the
same interests out there.  I am constantly reminded that the Internet
is a huge agent for the fostering of communities.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who has dropped me a line!</p>

<p>The content of these pages would be a lot poorer without the contributions
I have received from many people, ranging from simple corrections to
extremely generous photographic contributions.  I would like to express
my gratitude to:</p>
