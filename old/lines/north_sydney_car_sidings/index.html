<h1>North Sydney Car Sidings</h1><div class="menubox"><ul class="simple"><li><a href="history.html">History</a></li> </ul></div><p>Before the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the North Shore line
extended from Waverton to a terminus at the southern tip of Milsons
Point (where it met a ferry for the trip to the city). When the bridge
was built, the section from Waverton onwards was redesignated as the
North Sydney Car Sidings, and used to store suburban trains during the
off-peak period.
</p>
<p>
This short section actually included two versions of Milsons Point
station, which were used at various times. The original station was built
at the tip of the peninsular. In May 1915, this station was closed to
allow construction on the bridge to commence, and a newer version built
about 200m back up the line. The old station was retained for its loco
servicing facilities.
</p>
<p>
This new setup was very unpopular with the public, and the old station
was brought back into use in July of the same year. This lasted until
1924, when construction forced the final closure and demolition of the
old station, and the new station was brought back into use.
</p>
<p>
In March 1932, the Harbour Bridge opened and traffic began to use the line
over the bridge, including the current elevated version of Milsons Point
station. The old section of line from Waverton down to the waterline
was closed to passenger traffic and re-opened as the Car Sidings branch.
The second station was demolished and the track terminated at its current
position.
</p>
<p>
Today, it is still used for storage purposes.</p><br clear="all" /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><th style="text-align: right;">km</th> <th width="8px" /> <th /> <th>Name</th> <th width="8px" /> <th>Facility</th> <th width="8px" /> <th>Status</th> <th width="8px" /> <th>Opened</th> <th width="8px" /> <th>Closed</th> <th width="8px" /> <th align="right">Location</th> <th width="8px" /> <th align="center">Photos</th> <th width="8px" /> <th align="center">Diagrams</th></tr><tr><td align="right">0.00</td> <td width="8px" /> <td><img src="../images/jct_stn0_i_ii.gif" /></td> <td><a href="waverton.html">Waverton</a></td> <td width="8px" /> <td>Station</td> <td width="8px" /> <td>In Use</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">1-May-1893</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">-</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">6.110</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">4</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td align="right">0.91</td> <td width="8px" /> <td><img src="../images/tnl_i.gif" /></td> <td><a href="lavender_bay_tunnel.html">Lavender Bay Tunnel</a></td> <td width="8px" /> <td>Tunnel</td> <td width="8px" /> <td>In Use</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">-</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">-</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">7.020</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">-</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td align="right">1.73</td> <td width="8px" /> <td><img src="../images/sdg_i_ia.gif" /></td> <td><a href="north_sydney_car_sidings.html">North Sydney Car Sidings</a></td> <td width="8px" /> <td>Siding</td> <td width="8px" /> <td>In Use</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">unknown</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">-</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">7.845</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">5</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td align="right"></td> <td width="8px" /> <td><img src="../images/stn_aa.gif" /></td> <td><a href="milsons_point_2nd.html"><i>Milsons Point (2nd)</i></a></td> <td width="8px" /> <td><i>Station</i></td> <td width="8px" /> <td><i>Closed</i></td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">unknown</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">unknown</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right"></td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">-</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td align="right"></td> <td width="8px" /> <td><img src="../images/stn1_a.gif" /></td> <td><a href="milsons_point_1st.html"><i>Milsons Point (1st)</i></a></td> <td width="8px" /> <td><i>Station</i></td> <td width="8px" /> <td><i>Closed</i></td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">unknown</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">unknown</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right"></td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">-</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">-</td></tr></table>
