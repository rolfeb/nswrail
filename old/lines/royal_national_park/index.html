<h1>The Royal National Park Branch</h1><div class="menubox"><ul class="simple"><li><a href="history.html">History</a></li> </ul></div><p>The Royal National Park line linked the station of Loftus on the South
Coast Line to the nearby Royal National Park. The line opened with
the main line and at various times served an army camp, park visitors
and residents of nearby Grays Point. At its peak, 25 services were
provided on weekends. When electric trains were introduced in 1926,
this branch was surprisingly included in the electrification.
</p>
<p>
The Scouts Platform was introduced in 1946 to serve the nearby NSW
Scouts Jamboree of that year. The original terminus station boasted
a 10-car island platform, goods bank and 5 sidings.
</p>
<p>
Services were reduced in the 60s and 80s, and by the mid 1980s only two
trains a week serviced the branch. Because of this, it was sometimes
used for unusual purposes. Following the 1990 Cowan Bank collision,
the branch was used to test where automatic sanders could insulate
a train's wheels from the track circuit (they could). It was also used for
driver training, and track irregularities from wheel skids are still visible
is places.
</p>
<p>
In 1978, the old The Royal National Park station was closed to make
way for an improved national park visitors centre. A new station
was constructed adjacent to the site, and opened in time for the park's
centenary the following year.
</p>
<p>
In 1991, a signalling problem caused the suspension of services. When
it was found that $400 000 would be required to bring the line up to
acceptable standard, the line was officially closed. At the time,
patronage was an average of 3 people per train.
</p>
<p>
Two years later the line was taken over by the Loftus-based Sydney
Tramway Museum, who now use it to run tourist trams from Loftus to
the new The Royal National Park platform.</p><br clear="all" /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><th style="text-align: right;">km</th> <th width="8px" /> <th /> <th>Name</th> <th width="8px" /> <th>Facility</th> <th width="8px" /> <th>Status</th> <th width="8px" /> <th>Opened</th> <th width="8px" /> <th>Closed</th> <th width="8px" /> <th align="right">Location</th> <th width="8px" /> <th align="center">Photos</th> <th width="8px" /> <th align="center">Diagrams</th></tr><tr><td align="right">0.00</td> <td width="8px" /> <td><img src="../images/jct0_t_ii.gif" /></td> <td><a href="loftus_junction.html"><i>Loftus Junction</i></a></td> <td width="8px" /> <td><i>Junction</i></td> <td width="8px" /> <td><i>Closed</i></td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">-</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">-</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">26.580</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">-</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td align="right">0.40</td> <td width="8px" /> <td><img src="../images/stn_tt.gif" /></td> <td><a href="scouts_camp_platform.html"><i>Scouts Camp Platform</i></a></td> <td width="8px" /> <td><i>Platform</i></td> <td width="8px" /> <td><i>Closed</i></td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">26-Dec-1899</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">unknown</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">26.980</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">1</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td align="right">1.84</td> <td width="8px" /> <td><img src="../images/stn1_t.gif" /></td> <td><a href="the_royal_national_park.html">The Royal National Park</a></td> <td width="8px" /> <td>Station</td> <td width="8px" /> <td>In Use</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">9-Mar-1886</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">-</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="right">28.420</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">6</td> <td width="8px" /> <td align="center">-</td></tr></table>
