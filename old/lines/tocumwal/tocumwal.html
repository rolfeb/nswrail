When the line opened there was a pair of sidings and  a simple 55m platform.  There were not even watering facilities for the locos.  The following year an engine shed was added, and the existing Victorian turntable was made dual gauge.  By 1927 a transfer yard had been built on the eastern side of the location.  In addition a line now extended south to join the now dual-gauge siding serving the Wise Bros flour mill and grain shed.  By 1940 a separate standard-gauge turntable had been added at the north-east end of the yard.  The two platforms had been combined into a single 260m platform.  By the following year, there was a transhipping platform with Shell's depot on the far east of the yard, and more sidings had been added to the north.</td></tr> <tr bgcolor="#f0f8ff" valign="top"><td width="15%"><b>Current status:</b></td> <td>Large platform and station building remain.  Station is partly restored but boarded up.  Some remains of yard to the east.  A turntable still exists, with a site dug for a second. No remains of transfer yard.</td></tr> </table><dl> <dt><b>Photographs:</b></dt><dd><a href="photos/tocumwal05.html"><img src="photos/tocumwal05-small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp<a href="photos/tocumwal06.html"><img src="photos/tocumwal06-small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp<a href="photos/tocumwal01.html"><img src="photos/tocumwal01-small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp<a href="photos/tocumwal02.html"><img src="photos/tocumwal02-small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp<a href="photos/tocumwal03.html"><img src="photos/tocumwal03-small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp<a href="photos/tocumwal04.html"><img src="photos/tocumwal04-small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp<a href="photos/tocumwal07.html"><img src="photos/tocumwal07-small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp<a href="photos/tocumwal08.html"><img src="photos/tocumwal08-small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp<a href="photos/tocumwal09.html"><img src="photos/tocumwal09-small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp<a href="photos/tocumwal10.html"><img src="photos/tocumwal10-small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp</dd></dl>
