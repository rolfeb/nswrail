        <p>This section explains the Administrative features of MCC. You should 
          only read this section after you have installed your MCC (or upgraded) 
          and verified that it is working properly. The following explanations 
          will help you get your solution working! </p>
        <p><a name="admin"><b>Admin User</b></a> 
        <p>You need to log in as an administrator to perform administrative functions, 
          which means either the default &quot;admin&quot; username, or a username 
          in which you were bestowed administrator rights. Default 
          login is <br>
          user: &quot;admin&quot; <br>
          pass: &quot;j2use&quot; <br>
          It is <b>strongly recommended that you change the admin password</b> 
          to something more secure. And of course, make sure to remember your 
          password, and to keep it safe. </p>
        <p><a name="priv"><b>Admin Privilege</b></a> </p>
        <p>There are many things that the admin can see that other members cannot see. This includes obvious access to the admin center, 
          but there is a lot more! See the e-mail addresses of all your members 
        in the memberlist. With this priviledge comes 
          &quot;power&quot; -and- &quot;responsibility&quot;. Use it wisely, and be careful, you don't 
          want to annihalate a users account or data by way of accident or neglect, 
          and you do not want to upset  users by becoming power hungry.</p>
        <p><a name="center"><b>Admin Center</b></a></p>
        <p>The &quot;Admin Center&quot; allows you to perform many functions and 
          configurations for your MCC. After you have logged in as an Administrator, 
          you will find an &quot;admin button&quot; in the top menu. Click on the button to enter the &quot;Admin Center&quot;. 
        <p></p>
        <p> Once there, you will see a lot of interesting things, such as the 
          &quot;Configuration&quot;, &quot;Member Controls&quot; and &quot;Area Controls&quot; 
         
          sections. The options under each section are fairly self-explanatory.  </p>
