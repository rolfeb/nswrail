        <p>Functions you are permitted to perform for areas </p>
        <p><b><a name="Edit Areas">Edit Areas</a></b> 
        <p> You are presented with a hyperlinked 
          list of area names. You may click on any of the names to find details 
          of the area  and  you are able 
          to modify these parameters. At the top left corner of the list you 
        find the NEW hyperlink that you can use the create a new area. For each 
        area you can define to include the username&nbsp;and password into the 
        hyperlink used by the member to access the area. This saves the member 
        retyping his password many times but is for some browser less save, 
        because the show the password in the url. We added also javascript support 
        to open an area. We added a default script that will open a new popup 
        window when you use the action popup. For editing the script see <a href="configuration.html#Edit Area Redirect script">configuration 
        edit arearedirect script</a> and for more details about defining area 
        see the <a href="tutorial.html#What to do after installation">tutorial</a>. 
        Arealist sortkey is used to sort your items on the homepage. When hide 
        area form list is selected the area will not be shown on homepage. Disable 
        password generation will stop creating password, htaccess&nbsp;files. 
        This options is handy if you want to use one directroy but have to entries 
        on your homepage. When is requestable is checked members can request 
        access, to this area when they are not authorized. Note show not authorized 
        areas should be active in preference and settings to make this work.  </p>

        <p>When MCC is working properly you will never need to use this function. 
        The functions is always automaticly called if a member, group or area 
        field is changed that has an impact on the protected directory. For 
        all protected directory the .htpasswd and .htaccess are recreated. If 
        an area is inactive the files will be empty.</p>
