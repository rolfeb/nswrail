      <DIV class="content"> 
        <p>From this menu you can send messages to all members who've registered 
          and entered their email addresses. You may 
          edit the distribution list, or send messages to all. Useful for important 
          update/news information. However, use sparingly, because the solution 
        doesn't have 
          an &quot;opt in/out&quot; feature yet, and may users may object to having messages 
          sent to them without their authorization. </p>
        <p><b><a name="Upload Member Data">Upload Member Data</a></b></p>
        <p>MCC provides the ability to upload members form an external source. 
        Giving you the possiblity to migrate users form other systems. The file 
        should contain for each member a line and the fields within the line 
        are separated by a '|'. The sequence of fields is as follows: <font color="red">Name 
        | Password | Full Name | E-Mail | Active (1/0=on/off)&nbsp;| Admin (1/0=on/off)&nbsp;| 
        Group1+Group2 | Area1+Area2 | Flex Fields</font>. <b>Do not</b> put 
        spaces between the separators, here it's only done to make the helpfile 
        readable. If a member should be added to more then one group or area 
        use '+' as a separator between the items. If you are using the flexprofile 
        options of MCC to extented the profile with additional fields, you can 
        add the fields at the end of the line, each field separated by '|'. 
        Be aware that no syntax checking is done and that lines starting with 
        # are threaded as comments. </p>
