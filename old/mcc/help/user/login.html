        <P> Once you have registered, or if you are returning to a site, you can 
          login to the site.&nbsp; In the menu bar  you will find 
          an image/text that says &quot;Login&quot;.&nbsp; If it says &quot;Logout&quot; 
          you are already logged in.&nbsp; This can happen if you've already logged 
          in before and chosen to have the MCC remember who are you are.&nbsp; 
          This places a cookie on your system.&nbsp; Once you choose &quot;Login&quot; 
          you will be prompted for your user name and password.&nbsp; If the combination 
          is correct you will be allowed to navigate MCC as a user. </P>
          <a name="logout"><B>Logging Out  </B></a> 
        <P> If you are done browsing the forum you may decide to logout.&nbsp; 
          Perhaps you share a workstation with someone else, in this case you 
          would want to log out of the forum upon leaving.&nbsp; When you are 
          logged in you will see &quot;Logout&quot; in the forum menu, select 
          this and the forum will log your user name out. 
        <P> If your desired username is available, you will either be able to 
          login or you will receive an email with a temporary password - again 
          this depends on what type of registration the administrator has set 
          the forum to. 
        <P>   <a name="forgot"><B>Forgot Password  </B></a> 
        <P> If you're trying to login  but you forget your password 
          or have lost it, you can retrieve it using the lost password tool.&nbsp; 
          On the login screen, next to the username field, it says &quot;Forgot 
          password?&quot; Click this to be taken to the &quot;forgot password&quot; 
          form.&nbsp; Enter your username on this screen and press the Send button.&nbsp; 
          Your password will be sent to the email address registered to that username.
