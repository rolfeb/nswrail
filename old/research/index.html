<h1>Research</h1>

This page contains some some articles and resources which may prove
useful to people interested in learning more about NSW railways.

<dl>
<dt><b>ARHS(NSW) Resource Centre</b>
<dd>
The Australian Railway Historic Society (NSW)
<a href="http://www.arhsnsw.com.au/resource.htm">Resource Centre</a>
is a large repository of materials covering the history of railways in NSW.
They are open to the public.
<p>


<dt><b>NSW Track Diagrams and Circulars</b>
<dd>
If you are interested in Track Diagrams and Circulars for NSW, then the
"NSW Railway Track and Signal Diagrams" CD from the
<a href="http://www.arhsnsw.com.au/">ARHS - NSW division</a> is
highly recommended.
<p>


<dt><b><i>Names of Railway Stations in New South Wales</i></b>
<dd>
<b>Patrick James</b> has kindly scanned in C. A. Irish's 1927 text, <i>Names
of Railway Stations in New South Wales.  With their Meaning and Origin.</i>.
The paper is available <a href="irish.html">online</a>.  A more up-to-date
reference is John Forsyth's <i>How And Why of Station Names: Meanings and
Origins</i>, which you may find in a reasonable-sized library.
<p>


<dt><b>ARHS Bulletin / Australian Railway History index</b>
<dd>
The <i>ARHS Bulletin</i> magazine is a magazine which caters to people
interested
in Australian Railway history.  It has been in print for over 60 years and
is an invaluable source of historical information.  It was recently renamed
<i>Australian Railway History</i>.
<b>Howard Quinlan</b>
created an index of the Bulletin for the years up to 1987.  This was put into
electronic form and made available by <b>David Virgo</b>.  Finally, 
<b>Geoff Lambert</b> made corrections and added entries up to Dec 2000
(now updated to Feb 2002 by me).
<p>
I have created a
<a href="/cgi-bin/bulletin_search.cgi">search page</a>
allows you to find articles by various criteria. The
articles themselves are not online, but you could check in a major
library or visit the
<a href="http://www.arhsnsw.com.au/resource.htm">ARHS Railway Resource Centre</a>
to read them.
<p>

<dt><b>Historic Parish Maps</b>
<dd>
The NSW Department of Lands has made a huge range
of old
<a href="http://parishmaps.lands.nsw.gov.au/pmap.html">parish maps</a>
available.  If you are trying to track down old branches or stations in NSW,
these maps are invaluable. 

You can find out which parish a location belongs to at the NSW Geographic Names
Board's

<dt><b>South Maitland Collieries</b>
<dd>
I have written a short summary <a href="smr/index.html">article</a>
on the collieries of the South Maitland Railway.
<p>

<dt><b>Widemere Quarry Branch</b>
<dd>
Karina Hall has written an <a href="widemere/index.html">article</a>
on this branch which ran from Fairfield to the nearby quarry.
<p>


<dt><b>Safeworking Documents</b>
<dd>
The NSW RIC (Railway Infrastructure Corporation) has made available the
<a href="http://railsafe.ric.nsw.gov.au/">Safeworking Online</a>
page, covering the rules and regulations for operations in NSW.
