<h1> Names of Railway Stations in New South Wales.  With their Meaning and Origin.  by C. A. IRISH. </h1>

<p>The contents of this page were kindly supplied by <b>Patrick James</b>.</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<p> This paper by C. A. Irish, written in 1926/1927, has been copied from the
published article.  Some 1125 station names are given.  In accord with the
author's foreword, errors, where found, have been corrected. Irish's meaning
for Nulabor is wrong.  This word is of Latin origin, not Aboriginal. The
meaning and/or origin of other entries may also be wrong.  Spelling errors,
from when the text was scanned, may now be present.  The word Koori has been
used to replace words which perhaps were acceptable to the mono-cultural
society of 1926/1927, but which are derogatory to the Australian Aborigines
and which, are unacceptable now.</p>

<p>Railway lines referred to in the paper are listed below.  Station names
changed after 1926/1927 have not been updated.  Similarly railway lines and
stations constructed after 1926/1927 have not been added.  With the cultural
exceptions above, the intention has been to maintain the paper as an historic
document that reflects the New South Wales Government Railways of
1926/1927.</p>

<p>No other works by C. A. Irish are listed by Royal Australian Historical
Society.  Similarly there are no references to C. A. Irish in the State
Library indexes</p>
