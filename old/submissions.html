<h1>Photographic Submissions</h1>

<p>Photographic submissions are most welcome!   I have limited time to
process submissions, so if you can follow these guidelines it would
make my job a lot easier...</p>

<h2>Format</h2>

<p>I can handle pretty much any image size or format, however I generally
publish the images no greater than 700 pixels across (landscape) or 700
pixels high (portrait), in JPEG format.  If you can submit photos in that
size, it makes my job easier.  Signal diagrams or other which contain text
are often displayed at higher sizes.</p>

<p>Don't worry about the size of the email, as they get downloaded automatically
overnight.</p>

<h2>Cropping</h2>

<p>I don't crop photos I receive, except to remove borders.  It's much easier
if I don't have to do this.</p>

<h2>Dates</h2>

<p><em>Please</em> indicate the date the photo was taken, even if you only know the
month or year.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>If you can supply a description of the content, then I can just cut and paste
it into the web page.  If nothing else, <em>please</em> at least tell me the
direction the photo was taken, so I don't have to dig out a diagram to
figure it out for myself!</p>

<h2>Duplicates</h2>

<p>Before sending them in, please check that I don't have the same shot already
(it happens!).  Of course, if your photo is much better in quality, then
feel free to send it.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>

<p>The broad theme behind these pages is to record the infrastructure of the
NSW network before it changes or is lost.  Obviously then, historic photos
or ones which give a good overview of the location are especially important.</p>
