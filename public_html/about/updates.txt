[h1]Updates to nswrail.net[/h1]

It's been over a year since I have updated the site. Mostly over that period
I've been busy with other interests and activities. As a result, I've had to
scale back the work I do maintain the site. Going forward, that's probably not
going to change too much in the near future. Hence, I'm putting up this notice
so that people don't get too disappointed at the lack of activity or response
to enquiries.
</p>
Firstly, the site will still stay around.  If and when I get some time I will
try to work my way through the backlog of submissions I have.  And, I'm sorry
to say, the backlog is pretty long :-(  So, for the moment there's no need
to send more submissions!  I'm just not a position to process them.
</p>
Secondly, for those who asked, I don't have any health or other issues. It's
purely due to my spending more time on other hobbies such as prototyping with 
embedded electronics, astronomy, photography, and learning Japanese. Something
had to give!
</p>
Finally, I'd like to thank everyone for the submissions, feedback and emails
I have received over the years. I apologise for not responding in a more
timely manner.
</p>
Regards,<br/>
Rolfe Bozier
