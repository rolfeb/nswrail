These pages contain a variety of information about the NSW railway network,
both historical and current. The data can be broken down into four
categories: non-spatial (plain data), spatial (map data), photographic
and hypertext (links to related data sources). The intention of these pages
to make as much information as possible available on the net. Although
you will find pictures of trains within these pages, I have chosen to
concentrate on recording the infrastructure of the state, especially
on the abandoned branch lines.

You will probably have noticed that this site has not been updated for a
while...
Don't worry, it is not going to disappear, but I probably won't be
in a position to make any changes for a while.

For more details, see <a href="about/updates.txt">here</a>.

Much as I would like to, I probably won't be able to visit every
location in the state, taking notes and photographs! If you want to
contribute information or photos, then please contact me at
<a href="mailto:nswrail@pobox.com">nswrail@pobox.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
Much of the information and photos in these pages has been generously
provided by a lot of people. Their work has contributed immeasureably to
the success of these pages.
