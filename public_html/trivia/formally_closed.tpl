In NSW, closing a line requires an Act of Parliament, hence most lines which
see no traffic are technically "out of use" (even the lifted ones).
<p/>
The following lines are the only ones which have been formally closed:

<table class="clean">
<tr class="property">
  <td>Line</td>
  <td>Date Closed</td>
  <td>Act</td>
</tr>
<!-- BEGIN LINE -->
<tr>
  <td><a href="{URL}">{TEXT}</a></td>
  <td align="right">{CLOSED}</td>
  <td><a href="{ACT-URL}">{ACT}</a></td>
</tr>
<!-- END LINE -->
</table>

<!-- END CONTENT -->
